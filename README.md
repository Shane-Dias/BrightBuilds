## 🙏 Acknowledgements

BrightBuilds is the result of dedicated teamwork, creative exploration, and countless hours of problem-solving by a team of three students: Shane Dias, Serene Dmello, and Jacell Jamble.

Built entirely through our own initiative, this platform reflects what’s possible when curiosity meets collaboration — without external mentorship or institutional guidance. We hope BrightBuilds stands as a testament to the spirit of self-driven learning and innovation.

Special thanks to everyone who inspires students to build boldly and think independently.
