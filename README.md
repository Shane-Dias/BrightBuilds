# Project Setup Guide

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or Atlas account) - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the below snippet:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shane-Dias/BrightBuilds.git
cd BrightBuilds
```

### 2. Setup Frontend

```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

This runs your project on your local system at localhost:5173

### 3. Setup Backend

Now open another terminal in your main project directory and run:

```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
  node server.js
```

This starts your backend on localhost:5000

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file inside the backend folder with the following content:

```bash
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your actual MongoDB URI and your_jwt_secret_key with a strong secret string(32 characters long).

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

BrightBuilds is the result of dedicated teamwork, creative exploration, and countless hours of problem-solving by a team of two students: Shane Dias and Serene Dmello

Built entirely through our own initiative, this platform reflects what’s possible when curiosity meets collaboration — without external mentorship or institutional guidance. We hope BrightBuilds stands as a testament to the spirit of self-driven learning and innovation.

Special thanks to everyone who inspires students to build boldly and think independently.
